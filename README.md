This is a project I have done for the New Apprenticship course in relation to World Religions and the current trends asscociated with their growth on a global, regional, and national scale.

I am currently working on finishing the dashboard that will accompany this project for now the mean time the code is the best that can suffice along with a few Screenshots of the panels of said dashboard.

I would recommend create a virtual enviroment for the sake of the Dash and Plotly components unlesss you already have them in you main PATH

Thanks.
